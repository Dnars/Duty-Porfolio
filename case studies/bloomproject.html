                    <p>
                        With the continous increase of maternal death of pregnant women in Nigeria, Pregnant women
                        are still not accessing the adequate health care services offered by the country. The challange
                        faced by these women has resulted to miscarriage and loss of lives of both mother and child.

                    <p>
                        Every single day, Nigeria losses about 145 women within the childbearing age, making it the
                        second largest contributor to maternal mortality in the world according to UNICEF. The
                        Near-Miss and the Maternal Death survey reveals that the delay in accessing the adequate level
                        of care
                        plays a major role to its occurrence and maternal death.

                            After we have implemented the feedback gotten during the initial usability testing via
                            wireframe, we went ahead to test the high fidelity design to evaluate our solution.

                            While trying to book an appointment with a healthcare personnel/hospital, the calendar

                            indicating the current day. Participants couldn’t quite figure out what these colors meant.

                            TAKEAWAY
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Given our initial assumptions, we validated that pregnant women are not accessing the
                            adequate level of health care services in Nigeria due to the distance from hospital,
                            their religious belief, time and inconveniences they encounter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We offered a mobile solution to help pregnant women book appointment with a health care
                            personnel/hospital close-by at their own convenience, request for home checkup and
                            possibly put a call through in times of emergencies. This way, we are able to significantly
                            reduce the level of maternal mortality rate in Nigeria if not by 30%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While it might be difficult to onboarding health care expert on the platform, we
                            introduced a revenue model that will enable expert(doctors,nurses,midwives among others)
                            earn extra cash while doing the things they are passionate about. Something like a freelance
                            for medical expert.

                            Where we failed during the execution of this project, was us not considering the context
                            of use for each stakeholders. Taking into consideration hospital/health centers/maternity
                            homes, they are all likely to use a desktop most of the time. Instead of designing a
                            mobile application, we should have opt-in for a web or a desktop version of the product.

                            We will be reviewing the end-to-end process of this project again to capture what we
                            might have missed and also work on the web/desktop view of the hospital solution.
